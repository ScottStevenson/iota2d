Iota2d is a a 2D, physics-oriented game engine written in Java.
It was created by Scott Stevenson and Donovan Benoit as a software design project (while we were untertaking two other design projects and 5 other courses!). It is not currently under development, but we hope to clean up the project and release some nice demos at some point. Let us know if you are interested.

The physics portion of Iota2d was moved to http://code.google.com/p/bounce2d/.
